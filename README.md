# Fork of [FossifyOrg/commons](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/commons)

-   Aim was to make the [FossifyOrg/Contacts](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Contacts) app work in my old android 10 phone.

- use `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` to create a local build and use it as a module in (my fork)[https://github.com/RabbitRun47/FossifyOrg-Contacts] of the [FossifyOrg/Contacts](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Contacts) app
